# Fantasy-Baseball-App
 The fantasy baseball app is a great tool to help all fantasy teams in the ESPN Head-to-Head Categories Fantasy Baseball league. For the best viewing experience, I recommend shrinking the side panel to allow the visuals to grow as much as possible. The data source is updated every morning to add the previous day's data. Upon initial release, the data will only reflect current if the changes are committed to the GitHub repository.

 This Streamlit web app can be found at https://fantasy-baseball-botkinsbg.streamlit.app/

 The app consists of five tabs: Scoreboards, Standings, Totals, Rosters, Bonuses.

 ## Scoreboards
 This tab is an interactive weekly scoreboard with the ability to check every week's league-wide scoreboard. It features a prominent green and red color to show if the team is winning or losing the specific category. Any gold statistic denotes it is the league lead for the specified week(s).

 ## Standings
 Displayed at the top and center for all to see is our league champions. Below the championship banners is a current standings and previous standings.

 ## Totals
 The totals tab displays the amount of wins per category and highlights the top three of each category in gold. The below table displays the rank for each category with the some gold lettering criteria. When filtered to overall, you will see a summation or average of the season long statistics for team with the same gold numbers and rankings board.

 ## Rosters
 The rosters tab is the most versatile tab in the web app. This displays the league's players for all years. If the year has been completed, it will reflect rosters from the end of the playoffs. It is worth noting that during championship weeks, some names may be shown as free agents due to strategic last week cuts. 

 Once a year and player combination is selected, the players percentile ranks and season statistics will be displayed. All data is sourced from either Baseball Reference or Baseball Savant and contains customized links based on the player selected.

## Bonuses
The bonuses tab is custom to this fantasy league where the biggest winner each week receives a $5 payout with ties rolling over into the next week. The tables display each week's winner and the summation of prizes for every team.

This app was developed by Parker Geis and contains data from ESPN Fantasy, Baseball Reference, Baseball Savant, and Fangraphs. 

Version 1 was soft-launched on August 7, 2024.
